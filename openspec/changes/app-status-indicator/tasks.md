## Phase 0: Resolve Open Questions — RESOLVED (design review)

- [x] 0.1 "Up" definition — record in `design.md`.
      → Any HTTP response (2xx–5xx) counts as up; only a network-level failure or timeout counts as
      down. Recorded in `proposal.md` and `design.md` § Technical Approach.
- [x] 0.2 Opt-in scope — per app vs. default-on.
      → Per-app `healthCheck: boolean` (default `false`) on `SelfhostedAppSchema`. Recorded in
      `design.md` § Architecture Decisions.
- [x] 0.3 Coupling to `CONFIG_WRITE_TOKEN`.
      → Decoupled — the poller and `GET /api/status` run regardless of whether the token is
      configured; only `POST /api/config` stays token-gated. Recorded in `design.md` § Architecture
      Decisions and § Migration / Rollout.
- [x] 0.4 Check interval configuration — global vs. per-app.
      → Global `STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` env var (default `60000`), no per-app override in v1.
      Recorded in `design.md` § Architecture Decisions.
- [x] 0.5 Self-signed/invalid TLS certificates.
      → Accepted for status checks specifically (`rejectUnauthorized: false` on that one request),
      never process-wide. Recorded in `design.md` § Architecture Decisions and § Threat Matrix.
- [x] 0.6 HEAD vs GET for the check request.
      → GET — HEAD is unreliably implemented across self-hosted apps, and since any status code
      counts as "up" and the body is never read either way, GET's universal correctness wins.
      Recorded in `design.md` § Architecture Decisions.
- [x] 0.7 Frontend poll cadence relative to the sidecar's check interval.
      → The frontend has no separate hardcoded interval; `GET /api/status` returns `intervalMs`, and
      `AppStatusService` reschedules using that value. Recorded in `design.md` (revised during design
      review).
- [x] 0.8 Frontend bootstrap (before any `intervalMs` is known) and failure/retry behavior.
      → One immediate bootstrap request learns `intervalMs` before any recurring timer is scheduled
      (no assumed default). On failure: flat `RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` (15s) retries, up to `MAX_RETRIES`
      (4, ~1 minute total); if all fail, the service stops polling entirely for the rest of that page
      load (no exponential backoff, no infinite retry). Recorded in `design.md` (revised during
      design review).

## Phase 1: Schema Field + Sidecar Checker, Poller, and Route

- [x] 1.1 Add `healthCheck: z.boolean().default(false)` to `SelfhostedAppSchema` in
      `src/app/core/models/dashboard.models.ts`.
      - Acceptance: an app without `healthCheck` in YAML parses with `healthCheck === false`; an app
        with `healthCheck: true` round-trips through `DashboardConfigSchema.safeParse`.
      - Verify: `ng test` — extend `dashboard.models.spec.ts`.
      - Files: `src/app/core/models/dashboard.models.ts`, `src/app/core/models/dashboard.models.spec.ts`.

- [x] 1.2 RED: write tests for `server/src/status-checker.ts`'s `checkAppStatus(url, timeoutMs)` —
      200/404/500 all resolve `{ status: 'up' }`; connection-refused and DNS-failure errors resolve
      `{ status: 'down' }`; a request to a server that never responds resolves `{ status: 'down' }`
      after `timeoutMs`; a self-signed HTTPS cert still resolves `{ status: 'up' }`.
      - Acceptance: tests exist and fail (no implementation yet).
      - Verify: `npm test` in `server/` shows the new spec failing.
      - Files: `server/src/status-checker.spec.ts`.

- [x] 1.3 GREEN: implement `checkAppStatus` using `node:http`/`node:https` (picked by URL protocol),
      `rejectUnauthorized: false` only on this request's options, destroying the socket as soon as
      the `response` event fires (never reading the body). REFACTOR for clarity without changing
      behavior.
      - Acceptance: all of 1.2's tests pass.
      - Verify: `npm test` in `server/`.
      - Files: `server/src/status-checker.ts`.

- [x] 1.4 RED/GREEN/REFACTOR: `server/src/status-poller.ts` — reads `CONFIG_PATH`, parses it with
      `DashboardConfigSchema`, runs `checkAppStatus` in parallel over every `healthCheck: true` app,
      and updates a shared in-memory cache (`Map<appId, { status, checkedAt }>`). A missing or
      invalid `CONFIG_PATH` leaves the previous cache untouched and logs instead of throwing.
      Exposes `start(intervalMs)` and a way to read the current cache + configured interval.
      - Acceptance: only `healthCheck: true` apps are checked; cache survives a bad read; `start()`
        runs an immediate check before the first interval tick.
      - Verify: `npm test` in `server/` with fake timers and a temp-file `CONFIG_PATH`.
      - Files: `server/src/status-poller.ts`, `server/src/status-poller.spec.ts`.

- [x] 1.5 RED/GREEN/REFACTOR: add `GET /api/status` to `server/src/app.ts`, returning
      `{ intervalMs, apps: <cache> }` as JSON, no auth hook. Response is always `200`, even before
      any check has completed (`apps: {}`) or if `CONFIG_PATH` doesn't exist yet.
      - Acceptance: request against `buildApp()` returns the expected shape with no token header;
        response never includes `url` or other config fields, only `status`/`checkedAt` per app id.
      - Verify: `npm test` in `server/`, extending `app.spec.ts`.
      - Files: `server/src/app.ts`, `server/src/app.spec.ts`.

- [x] 1.6 RED/GREEN/REFACTOR: `server/src/index.ts` — remove the `process.exit(1)` guard on a
      missing `CONFIG_WRITE_TOKEN`; start the poller unconditionally via `STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`
      (default `60000`). Confirm `POST /api/config` still 401s every request when the token is unset
      (already true via `buildApp`'s existing auth hook — this task is about not exiting before that
      hook ever runs).
      - Acceptance: sidecar starts and serves `GET /api/status` with `CONFIG_WRITE_TOKEN` unset;
        `POST /api/config` still 401s in that case.
      - Verify: `npm test` in `server/`, extending the token-auth test group in `app.spec.ts`
        (or a small `index`-level test if one is warranted).
      - Files: `server/src/index.ts`.

**Phase 1 exit check**: `npm test` in `server/` green; `npx tsc -p server/tsconfig.json` clean.

## Phase 2: Frontend `AppStatusService`

- [x] 2.1 RED: write tests for `AppStatusService` — bootstrap request on construction (before any
      timer is scheduled) reads `intervalMs` and `apps` into the signal; each successful poll
      reschedules the next one at `max(intervalMs, MIN_POLL_MS)` and resets the retry count.
      - Acceptance: tests exist and fail.
      - Verify: `ng test` shows the new spec failing.
      - Files: `src/app/core/services/app-status.service.spec.ts`.

- [x] 2.2 GREEN: implement `AppStatusService` (`providedIn: 'root'`) per `design.md`'s Interfaces /
      Contracts — `statuses: Signal<Record<string, AppStatus>>`. REFACTOR for clarity.
      - Acceptance: 2.1's tests pass.
      - Verify: `ng test`.
      - Files: `src/app/core/services/app-status.service.ts`.

- [x] 2.3 RED/GREEN/REFACTOR: failure and give-up behavior — a failed poll retries every
      `RETRY_INTERVAL_MS` (15s) up to `MAX_RETRIES` (4) without touching `statuses`; a retry that
      succeeds within the window resumes normal `intervalMs`-driven polling; if all `MAX_RETRIES`
      fail, no further request is scheduled for the rest of that service instance's lifetime.
      - Acceptance: tests cover both the "recovers mid-window" and "exhausts all retries" paths.
      - Verify: `ng test` with `HttpTestingController` + fake timers.
      - Files: `src/app/core/services/app-status.service.ts`, `.spec.ts`.

**Phase 2 exit check**: `ng test` green; no new lint warnings.

## Phase 3: UI — Status Badge and Configurator Toggle

- [x] 3.1 RED/GREEN/REFACTOR: `AppCardComponent` — a `computed` signal reading
      `appStatusService.statuses()[app().id]`, rendered as a small corner badge (green `up` / red
      `down`) only when `app().healthCheck` is true and the id is present in the map; no badge
      otherwise. Follows the existing `iconUrl`/`showDescriptions` computed-signal pattern already in
      this component.
      - Acceptance: no badge for `healthCheck: false` or an unchecked app id; correct color for
        `up`/`down`.
      - Verify: `ng test`, extending `app-card.component.spec.ts`.
      - Files: `src/app/shared/components/app-card/app-card.component.ts`,
        `app-card.component.html`, `app-card.component.spec.ts`.

- [x] 3.2 RED/GREEN/REFACTOR: configurator app editor — a `healthCheck` checkbox alongside the
      existing `openNewTab`/`favorite` toggles, wired through `ConfiguratorStore.updateApplication`.
      - Acceptance: toggling the checkbox updates the draft; the value round-trips through
        save/load/export.
      - Verify: `ng test`, extending the configurator page/store test suites.
      - Files: wherever the per-app editor fields live under
        `src/app/features/configurator/components/`, plus `configurator.store.spec.ts` if the draft
        shape assertions need updating.

- [x] 3.3 Update `README.md`: document the `healthCheck` field, `STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` env var,
      the "any HTTP response counts as up" behavior, and the self-signed-cert acceptance. The
      `CHANGELOG.md` entry is still pending — add it when this feature is cut into its release (the
      first after v2.0.0), together with promoting the spec and archiving this change.
      - Acceptance: README accurately describes the new field/env var and its behavior.
      - Verify: manual read-through against `design.md`.
      - Files: `README.md`.

- [x] 3.4 Run the complete `ng test` and `server/` test suites together; `npx tsc -p server/tsconfig.json`.
      - Acceptance: everything green, no regressions in existing suites.
      - Verify: `ng test`, `npm test` (in `server/`), `npx tsc -p server/tsconfig.json`.
      - Files: N/A (verification only).

**Phase 3 exit check**: full regression suite green across both `ng test` and `server/`'s Vitest.

## Phase 4: Code Review Fixes

Findings from a `code-review-and-quality` pass over the full feature branch. See `design.md`'s
"Decisions (resolved)" for the details recorded there.

- [x] 4.1 (Critical) `checkAppStatus` could reject instead of resolving `down` if constructing the
      request threw synchronously (e.g. a malformed URL), and `runCycle`'s `Promise.all` plus the
      un-caught `void runCycle()` call sites meant that rejection became an unhandled promise
      rejection — which crashes the sidecar process by default on Node 15+ (verified empirically:
      reproduced the crash against the pre-fix code, confirmed it's gone after the fix).
      - Acceptance: `checkAppStatus` never rejects; one app's check failing doesn't stop others from
        updating that cycle or escape as an unhandled rejection anywhere in the call chain.
      - Verify: `npm test` in `server/` — new tests in `status-checker.spec.ts` (malformed URL) and
        `status-poller.spec.ts` (a rejecting `check` mock, asserted via a `process.on
        ('unhandledRejection', ...)` spy).
      - Files: `server/src/status-checker.ts`, `server/src/status-checker.spec.ts`,
        `server/src/status-poller.ts`, `server/src/status-poller.spec.ts`.

- [x] 4.2 (Required) `AppStatusService.stop()` didn't cancel an in-flight poll, so a stop-then-start
      sequence while a request was pending could let its stale response schedule a second, orphaned
      polling loop alongside the new one.
      - Acceptance: stopping cancels the in-flight request; its response (if it could still arrive)
        never schedules a further poll.
      - Verify: `ng test` — new test in `app-status.service.spec.ts` asserting
        `TestRequest.cancelled` and that only one polling loop survives a stop/start-while-in-flight
        sequence.
      - Files: `src/app/core/services/app-status.service.ts`,
        `src/app/core/services/app-status.service.spec.ts`.

- [x] 4.3 (Required) `design.md`/`specs/app-status-check/spec.md` didn't document that the frontend
      only polls while ≥1 application is monitored (an enhancement added during implementation,
      correctly documented in README but not in the spec docs).
      - Acceptance: design/spec docs describe the poll-only-when-monitored behavior.
      - Verify: manual read-through.
      - Files: `design.md`, `specs/app-status-check/spec.md`.

- [x] 4.4 (Nit) Redundant static `bg-emerald-500` class on the status badge, alongside the
      `[class.bg-emerald-500]` binding that already fully governs it — confirmed harmless at runtime
      (Angular's class binding wins), but misleading to read. Removed. Strengthened the up/down
      badge tests to assert the *absence* of the other status's class, not just the presence of the
      expected one.
      - Acceptance: template has no redundant static class; tests would catch a regression either way.
      - Verify: `ng test`.
      - Files: `src/app/shared/components/app-card/app-card.component.html`,
        `src/app/shared/components/app-card/app-card.component.spec.ts`.

**Phase 4 exit check**: `ng test` and `server/`'s `npm test` both green; `npx tsc -p
server/tsconfig.json` clean.
